# Module 7 - Further exploration

In this school assignment I was supposed to explore something further or something new, both in design and in coding. For the design I decided to explore brutalism and for the coding part, the Flutter framework and the Dart programming language.
## My Portfolio

I used this exploration to create a portfolio web application for my school projects. It's simple and brutal, there is a list of projects and when you click on one, more info will display clashed on top of each other. You can click on an info card and drag it to have a better look at it. I didn't have time to implement everything I wanted. The drag part was supposed to be drag and drop, the info cards were also supposed to change order on hover so the hovered one would appear on top. I also wanted to have the cursor change to move or grab when hovering the info cards but that wasn't working and as I sad, time ran out so I couldn't figure that out for now. There are more projects I want to add to the portfolio and I also need to polish the info of the ones that are there. Fonts and images are adaptive but the application isn't fully responsive, meening no layout changes have been made for mobile version.

## Live version
The Live version is currently missing all svg images. I was using flutter_svg package and I didn't realize that it doesn't support web. I will fix this later.

Here is a link to the live version:
